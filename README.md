Welcome to my Soccer Player Manager React Project. This app allows users to create a team of their favorite players
while working within a salary cap that they set themselves.  You can create players and assign them values.  Upon
adding a player to the team the players value will be deducted from the teams salary cap. 

To install and launch this app first you will need to fork and clone this repo.
In your terminal cd into the project folder and run bundle install.
Cd into the project-backend folder and type $foreman start -p 3000.
The app will automatically open in a new tab of your browser.
